FishSound, the sound of fish!</a></h2>
This is the documentation for the FishSound C API. FishSound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and encoding audio data using Xiph.Org codecs (Vorbis and Speex).<p>
libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a lower level layer such as UDP datagrams. When these codecs are used in files, they are commonly encapsulated in <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/">Ogg</a> to produce <em>Ogg Vorbis</em> and <em>Speex</em> files. Example C programs using <a href="http://www.annodex.net/software/liboggz/">liboggz</a> to read and write these files are provided in the libfishsound sources.<p>
For more information on the design and history of libfishsound, see the <a class="el" href="group__about.html">About </a> section.<h3><a class="anchor" name="contents">
